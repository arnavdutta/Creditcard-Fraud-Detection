# Creditcard-Fraud-Detection

* Here in this notebook, we will see how to deal with data imbalance and also how to tackle such situation.
* We will also see Under Sampling Technique as well as Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE).
* We will also use various machine learning algorithms to find out which one gives the better results in detecting the fraud transaction.
* Finally, at last we'll use a neural network to choose the better algorithm.
